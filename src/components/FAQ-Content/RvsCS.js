      <div className="faqs-content">
        <p>Cosmetic surgery is usually performed to enhance the aesthetic qualities of one’s appearance, whereas reconstructive surgery is performed to improve the body’s function, shape, and overall health, to remedy disease, and to treat congenital or acquired deformities.</p><br />
        <p className="faq-heading">What procedures are considered reconstructive surgery?</p>
        <p>Quite often it is difficult for a patient to distinguish between reconstructive and cosmetic procedures. Generally, if a procedure improves both your overall health and appearance, it is considered reconstructive.</p><br />
        <p>Some of the procedures which are considered reconstructive are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Breast Reconstruction</li>
          <li>Breast Reduction</li>
          <li>Otoplasty (Ear Setback Surgery) and External Ear Reconstruction</li>
          <li>Abdominal Wall Reconstruction</li>
          <li>Cleft Lip and Palate</li>
          <li>Congenital Facial Deformities</li>
          <li>Eyelid Surgery</li>
          <li>Facial Fractures and Wounds</li>
          <li>Hand Surgery</li>
          <li>Jaw Surgery</li>
          <li>Microsurgery</li>
          <li>Nasal Septal Deviation and Nose Surgery</li>
          <li>Scar Revision</li>
          <li>Skin Cancer Surgery</li>
          <li>Skin Grafts and Skin Flaps</li>
        </ul><br />
        <p className="faq-heading">Am I a good candidate for reconstructive surgery?</p>
        <p>If you have realistic expectations of the possible reconstructive surgery outcomes, keep a positive, optimistic attitude, and fully understand the procedures involved, then you are a good candidate for reconstructive surgery.</p><br />
        <p className="faq-heading">What are the risks associated with reconstructive surgery?</p>
        <p>The specific risks will vary depending on the type of reconstructive procedure being performed. All surgeries carry inherent risks of complications; however, in general, reconstructive surgery tends to pose a lower risk of surgical problems and side effects. Our surgeons evaluate each case based on the patient’s personal health history and will draft a personalized treatment scenario during your consultation.</p><br />
        <p className="faq-heading">What are the costs of reconstructive surgery?</p>
        <p>Reconstructive surgery is typically covered by your insurance provider. However, if reconstructive surgery involves both cosmetic as well as corrective procedures, the coverage may be partial, depending on your health plan.</p>
