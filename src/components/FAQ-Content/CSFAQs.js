      <p>Cosmetic Surgery FAQs
Here at the Utah State Plastic Surgery Society, we realize that patients may feel anxious and uncertain as they ponder the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery. In an effort to make our patients feel more confident and address some possible concerns and misconceptions, we have compiled a list of FAQs (frequently asked questions) to help you better understand the process.
Am I a candidate for cosmetic surgery?
Ideally, patients who choose to undergo cosmetic surgery have realistic expectations of the procedure and its outcomes. A strong self-image, an optimistic personality, and a good reason for pursuing cosmetic surgery are some of the most important components which make up a good candidate. A cosmetic surgeon will also perform a full analysis of your prior health history and any conditions which may affect the outcome of the surgery. Some of the factors to consider are:
Age
Weight
Recent traumatic injury
Heart, lung, or central nervous system disorders
History of cancer
Usage of oral contraceptives
Is there a minimum age for cosmetic surgery?
There is no minimum age requirement to pursue cosmetic surgery. However, there are certain procedures which are age-sensitive; in other words, a patient who is over 40 is more likely to undergo a facelift than someone who is 25 years old. Our board-certified plastic surgeons will review each procedure on a case-by-case basis to determine which procedure is best for you.
Will my insurance cover cosmetic surgery?
Insurance providers do not cover plastic surgery procedures that are performed for purely cosmetic reasons. However, some reconstructive procedures, including tummy tuck for gastric bypass patients and rhinoplasty for patients who have breathing problems, may be partially or fully covered by your insurance provider.
Can I finance my cosmetic surgery?
Yes. With the convenience of financing, you have more time to focus your attention on the recovery period.
How long is my recovery period?
The recovery period depends on the type of cosmetic surgery procedure that has been performed. On average, it takes a few weeks to resume normal activity, and three to six months for swelling and bruising to disappear completely. Make sure you refrain from doing any strenuous activity during your recovery period and taking medications or supplements which may thin the blood.</p>
