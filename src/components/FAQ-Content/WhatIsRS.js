      <div className="faqs-content">
        <p>Unlike cosmetic surgery procedures, which are performed to enhance the aesthetic qualities of the body, reconstructive surgery requires a surgeon to correct and restore the proper form and function of the body. Patients undergo reconstructive surgery for various reasons, some of which include the correction of birth defects, trauma or injury, abnormalities, and the effects of disease. Breast reconstruction, for example, may be performed on women who have undergone a mastectomy. Otoplasty (ear setback) may be done to correct abnormally protruding ears, and breast reduction is performed to relieve discomfort associated with the excessive weight of large breasts. Please take the time to read about the various reconstructive surgery procedures detailed below, and use the Utah State Plastic Surgery Society directory to find a surgeon in your area.</p>
