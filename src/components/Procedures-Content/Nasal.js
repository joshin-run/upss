      <p>Nasal Septal Deviation and Nose Surgery
Our board certified plastic surgeons have extensive experience in performing a variety of nose surgery procedures, including nasal septum corrective treatments. The nasal septum is a straight cartilage wall which divides the nose into two nasal cavities. The nasal wall misalignment or displacement may arise for several reasons including trauma, a congenital disorder such as a birth defect, and age. In such cases, nose surgery or septoplasty may be performed to correct nasal septal deviation.</p>
