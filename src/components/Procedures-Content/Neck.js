Patients who lost weight may have excess skin on the neck which has lost some of its natural elasticity. In choosing to undergo this cosmetic procedure, you can enhance the look of your neck by removing fat, excess skin, or tightening the neck muscles. Often this is included in a full facelift.</p>
