<p className="procedure-content">Congenital facial deformities affect the development of the skull (craniofacial deformities) and facial bones (maxillofacial or dentofacial deformities). Congenital deformities are present at birth and can be successfully treated with reconstructive surgery. Surgical treatment of facial deformities may have to occur in stages in order to achieve optimal results. The ideal time to seek surgical treatment is before your child fully develops. Our board-certified plastic surgeons will monitor your childâ€™s progress and educate your family on how to care for your child.</p>
