      <p>Breast Lift
Patients choose to undergo breast lift for a variety of reasons, some of which are aimed at enhancing the aesthetic qualities, combating the effects of gravity, pregnancy, and aging. Breast lift is also meant to improve the form and the basic functionality of the breasts, like the ability to participate more comfortably in sports and fit better in a wider variety of clothing. Breast lift is one of the safest and most widely performed breast surgery procedures. Many factors affect a patientâ€™s decision to get a breast lift, including loss of skin elasticity, sagging due to weight loss, and loss of firmness and shape due to pregnancy and breast-feeding.</p>
