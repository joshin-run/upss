      <p>Eyelid Surgery
Do you have bags or dark circles under your eyes? Lower eyelid droopiness? Loose or excess skin on the upper eyelids? Or perhaps puffiness of the upper eyelids, causing you to look tired or weak? If all or some of these conditions apply, then you might be a good candidate for eyelid surgery. Although eyelid surgery can successfully treat these problems, other treatments may be required to achieve the best possible results.</p>
