<p className="procedure-content">Reconstructive hand surgery may be performed if your wrist, fingers, or any other part of your hand has been impaired in any way. The goal of reconstructive hand surgery is to restore the proper function and flexibility of your hand and fingers injured in an accident or to correct a birth abnormality. Among the various conditions which hand surgery is able to treat are carpal tunnel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and Dupuytrenâ€™s contracture. Before deciding to undergo hand surgery, you must consult with a board-certified plastic surgeon to determine your eligibility and establish the course of treatment.</p>
