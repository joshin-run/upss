<p className="procedure-content">Scar revision surgery is meant to improve the appearance of the skin by removing or masking surface scar abrasions. There are several different types of scars which this procedure can eliminate. Scar revision surgery can get rid of contractures, which are after-burn scars that restrict movement by pulling the skin together during healing. Contractures can also restrict the movement of fingers, elbows, or knees, if a healing wound crosses a joint. Scar revision can heal keloids, which are hypertropic scars that exhibit pain and itchiness. Keloids are extensions of the original healed wound or incision. Discolorations and surface irregularities can also be treated through scar revision.</p>
