      <p>Breast Reconstruction
Breast reconstruction is usually performed on women who have undergone a recent mastectomy. This reconstructive procedure rebuilds the breast so that it resembles the size and shape of the original breast. Although breast reconstruction cannot guarantee you complete satisfaction, many women have reported an improved self-image after reconstructive surgery. A patient must have realistic expectations about the outcomes of the procedure and contact a plastic surgeon to discuss the benefits and risks associated with breast reconstruction.</p>
