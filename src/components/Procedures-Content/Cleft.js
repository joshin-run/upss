      <p>Cleft Lip and Palate
A birth defect known as cleft lip and palate may occur in children whose mouth tissue or lip deform during fetal development. An untreated cleft lip and palate can impede the proper functions of speech and the auditory system. Other complications may include dental cavities, displaced teeth, nasal deformities, and ear infections. You can avoid the development of these complications in your child by contacting a certified surgeon soon after birth.</p>
