Women who suffer from oversized breasts or breast hypertrophy often opt to undergo a breast reduction procedure. Quite often, excessive weight caused by large breasts creates discomfort and pain. To remedy such symptoms, women can reduce the size of their breasts by contacting one of the board-certified plastic surgeons affiliated with the Utah State Plastic Surgery Society.
