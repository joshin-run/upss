The laser wrinkle treatment improves the look of your face by eliminating dynamic wrinkles, frown lines, and fine wrinkles, which appear on the surface of the skin, and skin fold wrinkles, which extend from the nose to the chin. The type of laser wrinkle treatment depends on the type of wrinkles a patient chooses to target.</p>
