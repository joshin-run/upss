      <p>Laser Spider Vein Treatment
Laser spider vein treatment reduces the visibility of blood vessels which can develop on the face and legs. During a laser spider vein treatment, energy from the laser beam causes spider veins to coagulate and shrink. Laser spider vein treatment offers immediate results with minimal discomfort. Results vary depending on the size of the spider veins.</p>
