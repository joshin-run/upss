Some reconstructive procedures require the use of a skin graft, which is a patch of undamaged skin removed from one area of the body and transplanted to another. A skin graft is taken from the donor site, most often an area hidden under clothes, such as an inner thigh or a buttock. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia and is usually recommended for very large wounds, burns, ulcers, infectious areas, postoperative skin damage, and skin cancer removal.</p>
