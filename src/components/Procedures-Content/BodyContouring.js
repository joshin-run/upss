<p className="procedure-content">Body contouring is a term generalizing various cosmetic surgery procedures performed to give the body a more youthful appearance, for example, Arm Lift, Belt Lipectomy, and Lower Body Lift surgeries. The desired look may be achieved in stages or in a single session, depending on the types of procedures and the patientâ€™s overall health. An arm lift can remove loose or flabby skin and excess fat to create a more youthful appearance. Quite often, upper arms are among the first areas to display aging. With belt lipectomy, a patient can get rid of excess fat located around the waist area. This procedure is most often performed in conjunction with a tummy tuck. A lower body lift tightens loose or sagging skin in the thighs, hips, and buttocks.</p>
