<p className="procedure-content">Microsurgery utilizes a high-powered microscope to aid in the microvascular reconstruction. This novel technique has been on the forefronts of reconstructive and plastic surgery. Microsurgery allows anastomosis of small blood vessels and nerves and tissue transfers from one part of the body to another. In reconstructive surgical procedures, microsurgery allows for reattachment of severed parts and is utilized in free tissue transfer, replantation, and transplantation. Patients often choose to undergo microsurgery after mastectomy or tumor resection.</p>
