<p className="procedure-content">In abdominal wall reconstruction, patients are most often treated for defects caused by trauma, tumor extirpation, infections, or previous abdominal procedures. One of the main goals of the procedure is to restore the functional and structural characteristics of the musculofascial system. In the case a desmoid tumor develops on the abdominal wall, a resection of the affected skin and subcutaneous tissue may be required. Treatments may include musculocutaneous flap reconstruction or the use of bioprosthetic material. Contacting our certified plastic surgeons is a critical step in the preoperative evaluation process to determine your necessary course of treatment.</p>
