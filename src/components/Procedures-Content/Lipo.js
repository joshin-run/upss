      <p>Liposuction
Liposuction is a method of improving body contour by removing excess fat. Liposuction can be performed on various areas of the body including the stomach, buttocks, hips, thighs, breasts, arms and neck. The liposuction technique is quite simple, with minimal scarring and pain involved. The results of liposuction are long lasting but may be affected by aging, weight gain, or pregnancy. Liposuction utilizes a small metal tube, called a cannula, which suctions fat from targeted areas on the body through a small incision.</p>
