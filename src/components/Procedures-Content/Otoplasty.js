<p className="procedure-content">Otoplasty, or ear setback, is a cosmetic surgery procedure which aims to improve the appearance of a patientâ€™s ears. You may be a good candidate for otoplasty if you have protruding ears, large ears, or abnormally shaped ears. Otoplasty can reduce the size of very large ears, reshape the various bends in the cartilage, or bring the ears closer to the head. The procedure often involves reshaping, removing, or reconstructing the structural elements of the ear. The type of procedure performed will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, which is why contacting our board-certified plastic surgeons is a critical next step in the pre-surgery evaluation process.</p>
