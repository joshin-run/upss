Enhancement with breast implants is one of the most commonly performed cosmetic surgery procedures and involves only minimal risk factors. Women may choose to get breast implants for several reasons. Asymmetrical or underdeveloped breasts may prompt women to consider breast implants as an option. Other factors such as aging, weight loss, or childbirth may affect the volume and shape of the breasts.</p>
